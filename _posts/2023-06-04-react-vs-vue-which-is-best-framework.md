# React vs Vue Which frontend framework is best for big application

Hello everyone Today i'm talking about which framework is best fro UI development.

I'm a frontend software engineer and i work at React or vue and i have a more then 3 years of experience of both technology.

## These are the points which compare both framework

1. [Learning Curve React vs Vue](#learning-curve-react-vs-vue)
2. [Community Support](#community-support)
3. [Speed](#Speed)
4. [Project Complexly](#project-complexly)
5. [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## Learning Curve React vs Vue

Learning curve plays most important role when you are a developer and implement or learning in project. Because we learn framework or library so i can build or application as soon as possible.

Our brain remember easy when you look a similar things or object. And our resigning are also work in similar kind of thing.

Because of react look like of javascript and 99% of developer learning react alter JS so they understand easily and write code intuitively. Initially might be possible they not understand the depth concepts but they implement react and create UI

So when you consider both framework to learning curve **_React_** is so easy to learn and building stuff. Where vue take much more time to learning.

Because **_Vue_** if a framework and it's simplify the complexity under the hood that's way its take more time to understand how it's work. And lot's of developer are confuse when go first time to learn the vue.

Where react is just looking like the javascript function. Buy the way it's also take time when you deep dive how it's work under the hood. But in most of the developer understand easily

## Community Support

Community is the most important thing in library or framework. Because it's help our development processes. and community boost framework/library ranking.

We all know technology is not the thing where single person build maintain and help to the developer to succeed our journey. That's way community is most important things.

When i talk about the community of the both framework React has bigger community. It might be possible because React has a part of Facebook a big social media gient but it's a truth. You can see the below image

## Speed

Speed matter a lot. Because we move these kind of library and framework because of speed. So when i talk about speed in both framework React win this compotation because

React is known for its virtual DOM (Document Object Model) implementation, which efficiently updates and renders components. It uses a diffing algorithm to identify the minimal set of changes required and updates only those parts of the DOM. This approach provides React with excellent performance, especially for larger and more complex applications. React also benefits from a large and active community, which contributes to its overall optimization and performance improvements.

Where Vue also utilizes a virtual DOM implementation, similar to React, but with some differences in its update strategy. Vue's virtual DOM updates the DOM in a more fine-grained manner, which can lead to slightly faster initial rendering compared to React. Vue also leverages a template-based syntax, which can simplify development and improve performance in certain scenarios. Vue's reactivity system is highly optimized, allowing for efficient change detection and rendering updates.

Ultimately, both React and Vue are highly performant frameworks, and the difference in speed between the two is often negligible for most applications. The performance of an application depends on various factors, including the application's complexity, the quality of code, and the specific optimizations implemented by developers.

## Project Complexly

Today UI application are more complex as compare then 10 year later because today era application is web application not a web pages. so when you project is complex which framework perform better in devolvement. which framework fast your development process, and rapidly develop your project.

### React

1. Component-Based Architecture: React follows a component-based architecture, which allows for better code organization and reusability. This can be beneficial when dealing with complex project structures and large codebases.
2. Virtual DOM Diffing: React's virtual DOM and efficient diffing algorithm are designed to optimize rendering performance, particularly for complex and dynamic UIs. React's reconciliation process intelligently updates only the necessary parts of the DOM, minimizing unnecessary re-renders.
3. Mature Ecosystem: React has a vast ecosystem with numerous libraries, tools, and community support. This ecosystem can be beneficial when dealing with complex requirements, as you can leverage existing solutions and integrations.

### Vue

1.  Template Syntax: Vue uses a template-based syntax that can be more intuitive for developers, especially those coming from a traditional HTML and JavaScript background. This can make it easier to understand and maintain complex templates.
2.  Fine-Grained Reactivity: Vue's reactivity system allows for efficient change detection, making it well-suited for complex applications with many reactive components. It tracks dependencies at a fine-grained level, enabling precise re-rendering.
3.  Scoped CSS and Single File Components: Vue's built-in support for scoped CSS and Single File Components (SFCs) can simplify managing complex CSS styles and component structure, leading to improved maintainability.

Both React and Vue can handle complex projects effectively, and the choice between them depends on factors such as the project's requirements, your team's familiarity with the frameworks, and personal preferences.

## Conclusion

React and Vue are both popular and powerful frameworks for UI development, but they have some differences that should be considered.

In terms of learning curve, React tends to have an easier learning curve due to its similarity to JavaScript, while Vue may take more time to grasp due to its simplified complexity.

When it comes to community support, React has a larger community, which can provide more resources, libraries, and support for developers.

In terms of speed, both React and Vue are highly performant frameworks. React's virtual DOM and efficient diffing algorithm make it excellent for larger and more complex applications, while Vue's fine-grained reactivity and template-based syntax can lead to slightly faster initial rendering.

For complex projects, React's component-based architecture and mature ecosystem make it a strong choice. Vue's template syntax, fine-grained reactivity, and support for scoped CSS and Single File Components (SFCs) make it well-suited for managing complex templates and components.

Ultimately, the choice between React and Vue for big applications depends on factors such as your team's familiarity with the frameworks, project requirements, and personal preferences.

It's important to evaluate which framework aligns better with your development goals and offers the necessary features and tools to support your project's complexity. Additionally, considering factors like developer productivity and maintainability can further inform your decision.

To make a well-informed choice, it's recommended to build prototypes or conduct small experiments in both frameworks to assess which one feels more comfortable and efficient for your specific development workflow.
